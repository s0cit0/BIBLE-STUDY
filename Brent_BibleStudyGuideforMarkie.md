Brent’s Bible Study Guide for Markie
    This one-year Bible reading guide is designed to help you read through the entire Bible with
    understanding and context. The flow of each book follows four simple steps: watch, read, research, and
    review. This method helps connect the bigger picture of Scripture while also letting you reflect on each
    book deeply.
    How to Use This Guide
        1. Start with The Bible Project video overview for the book you’re about to read. This gives you
        historical and literary context.
        2. Read the book of the Bible itself at a pace that works for you. Since this is a one-year plan, aim to
        stay consistent daily.
        3. As you read, if questions come up, take time to research. Use a study Bible, online tools, or ask for
        guidance.
        4. Once you’ve finished the book, watch the Spoken Word Gospel video summary for that book to
        reinforce what you learned.
Markie, this journey isn’t about rushing—it’s about growing closer to God through His Word. Stay
faithful each day, and you’ll finish this year with a deeper understanding of the Bible and a stronger
relationship with Him.
