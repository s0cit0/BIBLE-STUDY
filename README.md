# Bible Study Guide

This one-year Bible reading guide is designed to help you read through the entire Bible with understanding and context. The flow of each book follows four simple steps: **watch, read, research, and review**. This method helps connect the bigger picture of Scripture while also letting you reflect on each book deeply.

## How to Use This Guide

1. Start with The Bible Project video overview for the book you’re about to read. This gives you historical and literary context.
2. Read the book of the Bible itself at a pace that works for you. Since this is a one-year plan, aim to stay consistent daily.
3. As you read, if questions come up, take time to research. Use a study Bible, online tools, or ask for guidance.
4. Once you’ve finished the book, watch the Spoken Word Gospel video summary for that book to reinforce what you learned.
